It's a question I...myself very deeply...the opportunity came up and,

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.770
when I think about the core

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:22.660
of why am here

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:28.730

And, how did you feel when you offer the role when you when you accepted the role 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:02.920
Humbled.

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.290
Excited those with the three words that come to mind I mean you know,

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.560
we have tremendous opportunity and

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.970
that's inspiring and I m also grounded on a chat in

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.770
a challenges in fact that is the adventure

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:21.390
that and the constraint which also in fact creates I think

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.340
the competitive zeal in

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:30.420
me to be able to do great work and as you step into this role what do you see

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.410
is your primary focus...going really 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:38.250
outset first thing I want to do and focus on is ruthlessly remove

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.560
any obstacles that allows to innovate every individual in 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.730
organization to innovate and then focus all...innovation

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:51.740
...things that microsoft can uniquely do you know,

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:55.710

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:06.190
we refer to ourselves is the do more company and I want us to be able to take that focus

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.670
and innovation forward and lastly I want every one of

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:16.200
us to find more meaning at work we spend far more dot...

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:22.630
too much diamond work for it not to have deep meaning you talked about this focus

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:26.280
on innovation where do you see the opportunities...microsoft.

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:32.580
...going forward it's a mobile-first cloud-first world

in other words everything is becoming digital and,

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:41.510
software driven so I think of the opportunities being

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:43.900

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:48.280
we need to be able to pick the unique contribution that we want to 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:49.600
bring and that's where

our heritage of being having been the productivity company 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:58.980
to now being the do more company where we get every individual

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:02.920

it's like no one else has and then you take the added combine it with that

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:26.940
fact that the world going forward is more of a software-powered world

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:31.980
